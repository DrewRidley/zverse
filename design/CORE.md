# ZVerse: High-Performance KV Database with Copy-on-Write and Locality-Aware Memory Mapping

## Executive Summary

ZVerse is a high-performance key-value database designed as a modern alternative to traditional storage engines. By leveraging key-timestamp interleaving for natural Copy-on-Write semantics combined with locality-aware memory mapping via mmap2, ZVerse delivers exceptional performance for graph traversal patterns, range queries, and temporal workloads.

**Core Innovation**: Direct interleaving of timestamp bytes into key bytes creates a space-filling curve that enables COW semantics without write-ahead logging, while mmap2-based locality detection automatically loads related data blocks into memory based on access patterns.

## Design Philosophy

### COW-First Architecture
- **No WAL Required**: Versioning is implicit through timestamp interleaving
- **Atomic Updates**: New versions are written to new locations, old versions remain immutable
- **Eventually Consistent**: Data consistency emerges naturally from the temporal ordering
- **Zero-Copy Reads**: Multiple readers access immutable data without coordination

### Locality-Driven Memory Management
- **Morton-Based Prefetching**: Related keys cluster naturally in the interleaved space
- **Graph Traversal Optimization**: Relational queries benefit from spatial clustering
- **Adaptive Loading**: mmap2 automatically brings relevant pages into memory
- **Range-Aware Caching**: Cache decisions based on Morton code proximity

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Key-Timestamp Interleaving for COW

#### Interleaving Algorithm
```
Original:
key = [k0, k1, k2, k3, ...]
timestamp = [t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7] (8 bytes, microsecond precision)

Interleaved (COW Key):
cow_key = [k0, t0, k1, t1, k2, t2, k3, t3, k4, t4, k5, t5, k6, t6, k7, t7, k8, t0, ...]

Benefits:
- Each write creates new COW key -> natural versioning
- Similar keys with similar timestamps cluster in memory
- Latest versions of related keys are spatially adjacent
- No explicit version metadata required
```

#### COW Semantics
- **Immutable Versions**: Once written, entries never change
- **Latest Version Queries**: Scan backwards from current timestamp
- **Point-in-Time Queries**: Direct seek to specific timestamp
- **Version History**: Range scan across timestamps for same key
- **Garbage Collection**: Future background cleanup of old versions

### 2. mmap2-Based Storage Engine

#### File Layout
```
Storage File Structure:
[Entry0][Entry1][Entry2]...[EntryN]

Each Entry:
- cow_key_length: u32
- cow_key: [u8; cow_key_length]  // Interleaved key-timestamp
- original_key_length: u32
- original_key: [u8; original_key_length]
- value_length: u32
- value: [u8; value_length] or overflow_offset: u64

Sorted by: cow_key (lexicographic order)
```

#### mmap2 Integration
- **Direct File Mapping**: Map entire database file into virtual memory
- **OS-Managed Paging**: Let kernel decide what stays in RAM
- **Zero-Copy Access**: Direct pointer access to mapped memory
- **Automatic Prefetching**: Sequential access triggers OS readahead
- **Pressure Handling**: OS evicts cold pages under memory pressure

### 3. Locality-Aware Caching Strategy

#### Morton Code Proximity Detection
```rust
struct LocalityManager {
    recent_accesses: RingBuffer<InterleavedKey>,
    hot_ranges: BTreeMap<Range<InterleavedKey>, HeatScore>,
    prefetch_strategy: AdaptivePrefetcher,
}

// Detect access patterns for SurrealDB workloads
impl LocalityManager {
    fn record_access(&mut self, key: &InterleavedKey) {
        // Track sequential access patterns
        // Identify hot ranges for graph traversals
        // Trigger prefetch decisions
    }
    
    fn should_prefetch(&self, current_key: &InterleavedKey) -> Vec<Range<InterleavedKey>> {
        // Return ranges likely to be accessed next
        // Based on graph traversal patterns
    }
}
```

#### Common Access Pattern Optimization

**Example: Multi-hop relationship traversal**

1. **Initial Entity Access**: Recent entities cluster due to timestamp interleaving
2. **Relationship Navigation**: Related data benefits from spatial-temporal locality
3. **Target Resolution**: Referenced entities often share similar creation times

**Result**: Complex data traversals become cache-friendly sequential access patterns.

### 4. Data Structures

#### Core Storage Types
```rust
use memmap2::MmapOptions;

struct ZVerseEngine {
    file: File,
    mmap: Mmap,
    index: BTreeMap<Vec<u8>, FileOffset>,  // original_key -> latest entry offset
    locality_manager: LocalityManager,
    current_timestamp: AtomicU64,
}

struct InterleavedKey {
    interleaved: Vec<u8>,    // Interleaved key-timestamp bytes
    original_key: Vec<u8>,   // Original key for exact matching
    timestamp: u64,          // Extracted timestamp (microseconds)
}

struct Entry {
    cow_key: InterleavedKey,
    original_key: Vec<u8>,
    value: EntryValue,
}

enum EntryValue {
    Inline(Vec<u8>),                    // Values < 4KB stored inline
    Overflow { size: u64, offset: u64 }, // Large values in overflow area
}
```

#### Interleaving Implementation
```rust
impl InterleavedKey {
    fn new(key: &[u8], timestamp: u64) -> Self {
        let timestamp_bytes = timestamp.to_be_bytes();
        let mut interleaved = Vec::with_capacity(key.len() + 8);
        
        // Interleave key bytes with timestamp bytes
        for (i, &key_byte) in key.iter().enumerate() {
            interleaved.push(key_byte);
            if i < 8 {
                interleaved.push(timestamp_bytes[i]);
            } else {
                interleaved.push(timestamp_bytes[i % 8]);
            }
        }
        
        // Handle keys shorter than 8 bytes
        if key.len() < 8 {
            interleaved.extend_from_slice(&timestamp_bytes[key.len()..]);
        }
        
        Self {
            interleaved,
            original_key: key.to_vec(),
            timestamp,
        }
    }
    
    fn extract_original_key(&self) -> &[u8] {
        &self.original_key
    }
    
    fn extract_timestamp(&self) -> u64 {
        self.timestamp
    }
}
```

## Query Processing

### Point Queries
```rust
fn get(&self, key: &[u8], timestamp: Option<u64>) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
    let query_timestamp = timestamp.unwrap_or_else(|| self.current_timestamp.load(Ordering::Relaxed));
    let cow_key = InterleavedKey::new(key, query_timestamp);
    
    // Binary search in mmap'd file for exact or previous version
    let offset = self.find_latest_version(&cow_key)?;
    
    // Record access for locality tracking
    self.locality_manager.record_access(&cow_key);
    
    // Direct memory access via mmap
    unsafe { self.read_entry_at_offset(offset) }
}
```

### Range Queries
```rust
fn range(&self, start_key: &[u8], end_key: &[u8], timestamp: Option<u64>) -> Iterator<(Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>)> {
    let query_timestamp = timestamp.unwrap_or_else(|| self.current_timestamp.load(Ordering::Relaxed));
    
    let start_cow = InterleavedKey::new(start_key, query_timestamp);
    let end_cow = InterleavedKey::new(end_key, query_timestamp);
    
    // Identify prefetch ranges based on query pattern
    let prefetch_ranges = self.locality_manager.should_prefetch(&start_cow);
    
    // Trigger OS prefetch for identified ranges
    for range in prefetch_ranges {
        self.prefetch_range(range);
    }
    
    // Return iterator over mmap'd range
    RangeIterator::new(&self.mmap, start_cow, end_cow)
}
```

### Write Operations (COW)
```rust
fn put(&mut self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
    let timestamp = self.current_timestamp.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    let cow_key = InterleavedKey::new(key, timestamp);
    
    // Append new entry to end of file (COW - never modify existing)
    let offset = self.append_entry(&cow_key, key, value)?;
    
    // Update index to point to latest version
    self.index.insert(key.to_vec(), offset);
    
    // Sync file metadata (no need for WAL)
    self.file.sync_all()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Graph Traversal Optimization

**Common Relationship Query Pattern**:
- Access entities created within a time window
- Traverse relationships between those entities
- Resolve to target entities

**ZVerse Optimization**:
- Recent entities cluster due to timestamp interleaving
- Recent relationships cluster due to similar creation times  
- Referenced entities likely also recent, already in memory
- Result: Multi-hop traversals become mostly memory-resident

### 2. Adaptive Prefetching

```rust
struct AdaptivePrefetcher {
    access_patterns: HashMap<KeyPrefix, AccessPattern>,
    prefetch_window: Duration,
}

impl AdaptivePrefetcher {
    fn analyze_pattern(&mut self, accesses: &[InterleavedKey]) {
        // Detect sequential scans
        // Identify relationship traversal patterns
        // Predict next access based on SurrealDB query patterns
    }
    
    fn suggest_prefetch(&self, current_key: &InterleavedKey) -> Vec<Range<InterleavedKey>> {
        // Return ranges to prefetch based on detected patterns
        // Optimize for common SurrealDB graph operations
    }
}
```

### 3. Memory Pressure Handling

```rust
impl ZVerseEngine {
    fn handle_memory_pressure(&mut self) {
        // Let OS handle eviction naturally
        // Focus on keeping hot ranges in memory
        // No manual cache management needed
        
        // Optional: hint to OS about access patterns
        self.madvise_sequential_for_hot_ranges();
    }
    
    fn madvise_sequential_for_hot_ranges(&self) {
        for (range, heat) in &self.locality_manager.hot_ranges {
            if heat.is_very_hot() {
                // Hint to OS that this range will be accessed sequentially
                unsafe {
                    libc::madvise(
                        range.start_ptr(),
                        range.len(),
                        libc::MADV_SEQUENTIAL | libc::MADV_WILLNEED
                    );
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

ZVerse's COW-based architecture with locality-aware memory mapping represents a fundamental shift from traditional database storage engines. By eliminating WAL overhead and leveraging mmap2's automatic memory management, combined with temporal-spatial clustering optimized for SurrealDB's graph traversal patterns, ZVerse delivers exceptional performance where it matters most.

The key insight is that SurrealDB's relationship-heavy workloads create natural access patterns that benefit enormously from temporal clustering - recent data is often related data, and related data accessed together should be stored together. ZVerse's interleaving strategy makes this happen automatically, while the mmap2-based approach ensures that the OS efficiently manages memory without complex application-level cache logic.

This design prioritizes the common case (graph traversals, temporal queries, related data access) while ensuring the worst case (random access) is no worse than disk speed, creating a storage engine that's both simple to implement and exceptionally well-suited to modern application workloads.
